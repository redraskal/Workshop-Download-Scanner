# Workshop Download Scanner

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2649842186

Forces Garry's Mod clients to download mounted workshop addons that include custom content required by the client (such as models, sounds, fonts...).

Some workshop addons will be omitted, thus decreasing initial client load time.

The current map and gamemode are automatically downloaded to the client and are ignored by this script (provided they are workshop addons).
